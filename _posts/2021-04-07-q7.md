### walkthrough

The first step is reaslsing that this is an excel spread sheet and not a txt file. There are multiple ways of doing this
- looking at the start and end of the file and reading up about what each type of file starts and ends with
- looking for cryptic clues inside the question. The word Excellent was used, 

The next step is to try and convert this to a excel spreadsheet. The way that i figured out how to do this was to change the file name to master_plan.xlsx, then go to google sheets -> open -> upload -> master_plan.xlsx then zoom out to 10%!
