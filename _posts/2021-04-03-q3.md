You find yourself in the office where all of the summer interns are doing their work. While scaling the outskirts of the room, you notice one of the interns receive a file, read it and then chuckle with someone on the complete other side of the room! After getting a glance at his face, his blushed cheeks might imply that that code wasn’t only communicating 1's and 0's. Can you figure out any other messages in the code?

```
memadd = 0
end = 2
except memadd as err
type array objs = get(memadd)
if (i < end):
    nObjs = count(objs)
    sort(objs)
    memadd++
    if (type(nObjs[i]) == str):
        next
    count(objs)
u_num = objs[end]
break
2 = 1 + 1

```

### walkthrough

Alright, its pretty obvious that this code is complete and utter garbage, i dont think youll get anywhere trying to run the code in your head, let alone a computer trying to understand this. Ok, it seems like maybe the code is just a way to obscure the fact that there is a different message being communicated. I did add a mini hint into the question by using the word "outskirts", but its not too hard to see the first letter of each line reading out a message

"Meet in 5 mins in cubical 2", As a baby, you have no idea why these two interns would be meeting in such a small space?! maybe to do some code review on that horrendous code!
 
Well it seems that you know that a computer will be free sometime soon! (and maybe some data that we can use strategically later!).
