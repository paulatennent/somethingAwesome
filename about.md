Hey! Im Paula :), I made Baby Hacker as one of my first projects so i hope you like it! Apart from making this, you can usually find me doing regex crosswords, looking at fractal art or changing the design of my dodgy website for the 3984716273th time

Baby hacker is a pretty beginer friendly CTF based around a story that highlights some pretty exagerated ideas of bad security found everywhere around us! You dont need any background in computer science or cyber security but could be helpful for practicing your problem solving skills.
