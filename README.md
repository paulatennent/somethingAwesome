# somethingAwesome
This is my Something Awesome Project for COMP6841 :)

What did i do?
1. i made a bunch of CTF questions, with corresponding walkthroughs. i covered a range of topics covered in the course, and some questions that i made up myself, such as:
    - cyphers
    - something
    - something else
    I'm pretty happy with how i chose this for my something awesome project since i ended up doing a bunch of deep dives into various topics, for example, if i was creating a question on cyphers, i ended up looking up and figuring out how nearly every cypher works so that i can pick one that works for the story/question! 
2. I based the CTF's around a story. This isn't too technical, but i made sure to relate it to security, so throughout the story you can see themes that we talked about from weeks 1-7, such as
    - Secrets
    - Physical Security
    - Trust
    - Data and Privacy
    - something else
    the story is that you have been brought to work by your mum on "bring your kid to work day" (you are a baby btw), and throughout the CTF you end up excaping places, getting through secure doors, finding peoples secrets and even meeting the CEO! There are 3 endings depending on things like which door/elevarot level you take (according to which CTF flag you find).
3. i put it all on a website. Origionally, i wanted to include a login system that keeps track of how many questions you've completed, but i was overly optimistic when writing my pitch and forgot to remember that although i know some front end and some back end coding, i don't know how to put them together. I also didnt know javascript. I ended up just writing a static website to host all the questions, helped me learn more abotu HTML and css code, while also keeping the website very secure (as there is no data to hack lmao). This part was mainly so that my friends, family and Brendan can see the questions and answeres easily. Some other info:
    - for the website, i used jekyll and github pages

You can find the code for the website in this repo, and if you go to https://paulatennent.github.io you can find the actual website. Sometimes this doesnt work since jekyll is a bit janky (if it looks broken or only part of the site is there), so you can see the questions in the _posts folder, or you can pull the repo onto your computer and run
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
then go to
